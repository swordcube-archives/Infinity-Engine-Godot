# Infinity Engine Godot
a really bad fnf remake in godot

please check out https://github.com/Leather128/LeatherEngineGodot if you want optimization please
it's like 1000x more optimized

it would be nice if you tried out this engine and LE godot because that would be so awesome and so cool

anyways yea this is bad code grrrr >:((((
