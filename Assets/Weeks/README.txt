WeekList.txt is only intended for Base Game weeks, as on Linux (from my testing),
The ordering seems to fuck up. If you need to order weeks for a mod though..

Create a file called:
"modname-WeekList.txt"

"modname" would be the name of your mod, in lowercase and with dashes.

Like so:
"my-cool-mod-WeekList.txt"
